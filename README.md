# Codeclause_goldenproject2_FlappyBirdGame
The objective of this game is to move the bird forward and avoid obstacles along the way. A bird is scrolled to the right side of the screen without getting hit by the pipes placed on its way as obstacles. The bird needs to be flapping constantly otherwise it will fall down and die. A button is used for this flapping.
The prerequisite of this project is the basic knowledge of python.

For this project, we are going to use the Virtual Studio Code IDE and the pygame module. Pygame is a library that is used in creating games in Python. It has four important things.

Game Loop,
Events,
Sprites,
Sound.

I have given the gallery folder which further contains audio,spriles files where we can find audio files and images which are useful in making this game.
